The Default pipeline for 'clean' method: 

fillna(s)
lowercase(s) 
remove_digits() 
remove_punctuation() 
remove_diacritics() Remove all accents from strings.
remove_stopwords() 
remove_whitespace() 



Texthero has four useful modules that handle different functionalities.

1. Preprocessing
2. NLP
3. Representation
4. Visualization

Preprocessing: It has different methods to clean your text dataset such as lowercase(), remove_html_tags() and remove_urls().

NLP: This module has a few NLP tasks such as named_entities, noun_chunks, and so on. Used for keywords and keyphrases extraction, and named entity recognition.

Representation: This module has different algorithms to map words into vectors such as TF-IDF,  GloVe, Principal Component Analysis(PCA), and term_frequency.
Used for representation of text data into vectors. It is used to analyze vector space. It offers clustering algorithms like K-means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical, and Meanshift.

map text data into vectors and do dimensionality reduction.
Supported representation algorithms:
1. Term frequency (count)
2. Term frequency-inverse document frequency (tfidf)

Supported clustering algorithms:

1. K-means (kmeans)
2. Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (dbscan)
3. Meanshift (meanshift)

Supported dimensionality reduction algorithms:

1. Principal component analysis (pca)
1. t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tsne)
1. Non-negative matrix factorization (nmf)


Visualization: The last module has three different methods to visualize the insights and statistics of a text-based Pandas DataFrame. 
It can plot a scatter plot and word cloud. 
Used for vector space visualization and used for place localization on maps
