Texthero has four useful modules that handle different functionalities.

1. Preprocessing
2. NLP
3. Representation
4. Visualization

𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠: It has different methods to clean your text dataset such as lowercase(), remove_html_tags() and remove_urls(). It is using Regex or Regular Expression 
Under the Hood. 

𝐍𝐋𝐏: This module has a few NLP tasks such as named_entities, noun_chunks, and so on. Used for keywords and keyphrases extraction, and named entity recognition.
It is using Spacy under the hood.

𝐑𝐞𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: This module has different algorithms to map words into vectors such as TF-IDF,  GloVe, Principal Component Analysis(PCA), and term_frequency.
Used for representation of text data into vectors. It is used to analyze vector space. 
It offers clustering algorithms like K-means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical, and Meanshift. It is uses 'Scikit-learn' for TF-IDF and count.

map text data into vectors and do dimensionality reduction.Supported representation algorithms:
1. Term frequency (count)
2. Term frequency-inverse document frequency (tfidf)

Supported clustering algorithms:
1. K-means (kmeans)
2. Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (dbscan)
3. Meanshift (meanshift)

Supported dimensionality reduction algorithms:
1. Principal component analysis (pca)
1. t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tsne)
1. Non-negative matrix factorization (nmf)


𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: The last module has three different methods to visualize the insights and statistics of a text-based Pandas DataFrame. 
It can plot a scatter plot and word cloud. Uses plotly and wordcloud under the hood.
Used for vector space visualization and used for place localization on maps
